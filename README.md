This project implements a bike theft detection system using deep learning techniques. It utilizes computer vision and deep learning models to identify potential bike theft events in a given dataset.

Summary: This bike theft detection system uses deep learning models, including YOLOv5, to identify potential bike theft events in a given dataset. It preprocesses the dataset, detects faces and bikes in the images, and applies a similarity score to determine if a bike theft event has occurred. The system saves the output images in separate folders based on the classification.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation, and further improvements can be made to enhance the system's accuracy and performance.
